    <p>The famous "Stroop Effect" is named after J. Ridley Stroop who
    discovered this strange phenomenon in the 1930s.  Here is your job: name
    the colors of the following words.  Do NOT read the words...rather, say
    the color of the words.  For example, if the word "BLUE" is printed in a
    red color, you should say "RED".  Say the colors as fast as you can.  It
    is not as easy as you might think!</p>
